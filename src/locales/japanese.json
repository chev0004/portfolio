	"intro": "I'm an 18-year-old web developer with over three years of experience building dynamic websites and applications. I focus on making web apps that are for the sake of convenience, things that would just make things a little easier. (I use Arch btw).\n\nI also speak Japanese fluently and have worked entirely in Japanese-speaking environments. With over 5600 kanji/vocabulary memorized, clear intonation, and a deep understanding of Japanese culture, I sometimes even fooled native Japanese into thinking I was also one!\n\nAside from development, I enjoy creating digital art when I’m not buried in code.",
